  title: What are the most common methods?
  bullets:
  - Prototype-based (aka center-based)
  - Points are more common to the prototype of the cluster they belong to than to
    any other cluster prototype

  title: Cluster Analysis for Data Mining
  bullets:
  - How many clusters?
  - Most cluster analysis methods use a distance measure to calculate the closeness
    between pairs of items
  - The quality of a clustering result depends on the
  - algorithm
  - ', the'
  - distance
  - function, and the application.

  bullets:
  - k-means clustering – Which k?
  - “Elbow method”
  - Try different k, looking at the change in the average distance to centroid as
    k increases
  - Average falls rapidly until right k, then changes little
